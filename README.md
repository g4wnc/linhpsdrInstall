# linhpsdrInstall
This is a simple script to install linHPSDR on a Raspberry Pi 3 or 4B.

To download and use the script, open a terminal session (Ctl-Alt-T) and enter the following on the Pi command line:
```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/g4wnc/linhpsdrInstall.git
cd linhpsdrInstall
sudo chmod +x linhpsdrInstall.sh
./linhpsdrInstall.sh
```
The script will reboot the Pi on completion and linHPSDR can then be run from the Pi menu - Other
